<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
Recommend to install through npm:
``` bash
# install newest sdk and download prebuilt binary file automatically
npm install agora-electron-sdk
```
Prebuilt c++ addon supported electron version 10.2.0 9.0.0, 7.1.2, 6.1.7, 5.0.8, 4.2.8, 3.0.6, 1.8.3
Usually you have to specify electron version of your application and whether to download prebuilt c++ addon or do node-gyp building locally by configuration in package.json:
```
// package.json
{
...
  "agora_electron": {
    "electron_version": "5.0.8",
    "prebuilt": true
  }
...
}
```

**For more detail of configuration, visit [wiki](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Electron-SDK/wiki/Installation-Configuration-in-package.json).**

### Usage
``` javascript
import AgoraRtcEngine from 'agora-electron-sdk'

const rtcEngine = new AgoraRtcEngine();
rtcEngine.initialize('<your agora app id>');
```

### When using without electron-webpack
When using directly within a web electron project with custom webpack configuration, you may see errors when compiling. It's because you have not properly configured loader for node addon. A convenient way to skip the compile process is to set `externals` property of your webpack config to `{"agora-electron-sdk": "commonjs2 agora-electron-sdk"}`

<!-- Plugins -->
## Plugins
In newest version we have supported plugins for customize videoFrame and audioFrame data. In other words, you can integrate cool features like video filter, face recognition with your own plugins in C++.

We have already implement an official plugin for video filter based on FaceUnity:
