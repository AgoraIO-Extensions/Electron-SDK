You must call the [leaveChannel](leaveChannel:) method to exit the current call before entering another channel. This method call is asynchronous; therefore, you can call this method in the main user interface thread.

 The SDK uses the OS X’s AVAudioSession shared object for audio recording and playback. Using this object may affect the SDK’s audio functions.
 If the [joinChannelByToken](joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:joinSuccess:) method call succeeds, the SDK triggers`joinSuccessBlock`. If you implement both `joinSuccessBlock` and [didJoinChannel]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:]), `joinSuccessBlock` takes higher priority than [didJoinChannel]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:]). If you want to use [didJoinChannel]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:]), set the `joinSuccessBlock` as nil.

 **Note:**

 A channel does not accept duplicate uids, such as two users with the same `uid`. If you set `uid` as 0, the system automatically assigns a `uid`. If you want to join the same channel on different devices, ensure that different uids are used for each device.

 @param token A `token` generated by the app server. In most circumstances, the static App ID suffices. For added security, use a `token`.

 * If the user uses a static App ID, `token` is optional and can be set as nil.
 * If the user uses a `token`, Agora issues an additional App Certificate for you to generate a token based on the algorithm and App Certificate for user authentication on the server.
 * Ensure that the App ID used for creating the `token` is the same App ID used by [sharedEngineWithAppId](sharedEngineWithAppId:delegate:) for initializing the RTC engine. Otherwise, the CDN live streaming may fail.

 @param channelId Unique channel name for the AgoraRTC session in the string format. The string length must be less than 64 bytes.
 Supported character scopes are:

 * The 26 lowercase English letters: a to z
 * The 26 uppercase English letters: A to Z
 * The 10 numbers: 0 to 9
 * The space
 * "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", "{", "}", "|", "~", ","

 @param info (Optional) Additional information about the channel. This parameter can be set to nil or contain channel related information. Other users in the channel do not receive this message.

 **Note:** When joining a channel, the SDK calls `setCategory(AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord)` to set `AVAudioSession` to `PlayAndRecord` mode. When `AVAudioSession` is set to `PlayAndRecord` mode, the sound played (for example a ringtone) is interrupted. The app should not set `AVAudioSession` to any other mode.

 @param uid User ID. A 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 1 to (2^32-1). The `uid` must be unique. If a `uid` is not assigned (or set to 0), the SDK assigns and returns a `uid` in `joinSuccessBlock`. Your app must record and maintain the returned `uid` since the SDK does not do so.
 @param joinSuccessBlock Returns that the user joins the specified channel. Same as [didJoinChannel]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:]).

 * If the frame rate is 5 fps, divide the recommended bitrate by 2.
 * If the frame rate is 15 fps, use the recommended bitrate.
 * If the frame rate is 30 fps, multiply the recommended bitrate by 1.5.
 * Calculate your bitrate with the ratio if you choose other frame rates.

 For example, the resolution is 320 &times; 240 and the frame rate is 15 fps, hence, the bitrate is 200:

 * If the frame rate is 5 fps, the bitrate is 100.
 * If the frame rate is 30 fps, the bitrate is 300.
